This was before GDExtension so I had to rebuild Godot for extensions to play FLAC and read audio metadata, I didnt have those extensions when taking the screenshots so the albumn art isnt visible

## Installation
Download the binary for your platform from the releases page (x86_64 for Linux/X11 or .exe for Windows)
and the .pck file to store along side it.

## TODO:
- Keyboard navigation
- Cleanup code and make it less error vunerable
